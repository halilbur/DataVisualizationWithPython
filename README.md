# HDI Analysis Project
This project aims to analyze the Human Development Index (HDI) dataset and gain insights into various socio-economic indicators. 
It focuses on the "Life expectancy at birth" column to examine the relationship between life expectancy and human development.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is the Human Development Index (HDI) dataset, which contains HDI values for different countries over time.

#Result

The analysis of the "Life expectancy at birth" column provides insights into the relationship between life expectancy and human development. 
It includes calculations of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and standard error. Additionally, it examines the distribution shape, identifies outliers, 
and visualizes the data using a histogram and boxplot.
